                Welcome to the high school section of the NSF BRIDGES project at UNCC! This website is intended to help
                high school teachers implement BRIDGES assignments in their classrooms. This article provides a concise
                overview and explanation of the website.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have not already set up BRIDGES with your IDE, now is a good time to do so. If you are using CS50, a tutorial is available
                 <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xNpz8rzzBkYhxbRVwZ6tuyfYgiTaNAaexcSUqMaTAUU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. If you are using any other IDE, a tutorial is available <a href="http://bridgesuncc.github.io/bridges_setup.html">here</a>.
            </p>

            <div class="note">
                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> The high school section of BRIDGES only uses the Java programming language.

            <p>
                This website provides instructional materials for the computer sciences courses AP CS A and Advanced
                Topics.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AP CS A:</strong> These assignments correspond to the AP CS A
                    curriculum as outlined in the <a
                        href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-a">AP
                        Computer Science A Course Description</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Topics:</strong> These assignments correspond to curricula
                    beyond AP CS A. Many of these topics are also present in first or second year college computer science courses.</li>
            </ul>

                Project-based learning is the foundation of BRIDGES. Each assignment is designed to teach computer
                science concepts. An assignment page has the following structure:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> This provides a basic overview of the project.</li>

                <li><strong>Details / concept explanation:</strong> Some assignments require further
                    information or explanation about a specific topic. This section is optional, and most assignments do
                    not include it.</li>

                <li><strong>Topics:</strong> This is a list of all the topics covered in the assignment.</li>

                <li><strong>Intended learning outcomes:</strong> Each assignment has been designed with specific ILOs in
                    mind. It is important to note that the ILOs are written with the assumption that all instructional
                    materials (see below) are used. So, if you adapt the assignment, the ILOs may change. </li>

                <li><strong>Instructional materials:</strong> This is the most important part of the assignment page.
                    The instructional materials consist of three sections: student, teacher, and resources.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Student:</strong> Each assignment includes a student worksheet which consists of
                        instructions, information, and questions for students as they program. The worksheets enable
                        students to work at their own pace, and the questions help you assess student understanding of
                        concepts. You can adapt these worksheets to meet the needs of your classroom.
                        Additionally, some assignments include test cases or example outputs to help students check
                        their work.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Teacher:</strong> Some of the more challenging assignments come with a teacher walkthrough
                      explaining the code and worksheet. Some assignments also include a rubric which you can
                      change if you wish.</li>

                    <li><strong>Resources:</strong> The resource section can vary significantly depending on the
                        project, but it will always include solution files and scaffold files. The scaffold is what you
                        provide to students, and the solution is the finished product. Scaffolds usually include
                        directions or assistance that correspond to the student worksheet. Additionally, the resources
                        section sometimes includes data files, additional tutorials, and links embedded in the student
                        worksheet.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> The documentation section provides links to all the relevant BRIDGES
                    classes used in the assignment. It is usually necessary to read documentation in order to complete the
                    student worksheet.</li>
